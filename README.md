# OpenLDAP-for-Ubuntu-18.04
**December 2nd, 2018**

With setting up OpenLDAP along with phpldapadmin in **Ubuntu Server 18.04**, you will be faced with deprecation errors revolving around **PHP 7.2**. This tutorial will show exact step-by-steps of how I got around those errors, as a creator on <a href="https://github.com/breisig/phpLDAPadmin">github</a> forked a version of phpldapadmin that eliminates the deprecated commands and allows it to work with the current PHP version.
